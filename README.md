# CCP Legacy Bulletin Translation
WIP repository for translating a the bulletin of the State Council of China 


## Objective 
Provide a reliable and unbiased (as much as possible) translation of documents pertaining to the 1989 protests. These documents (as far as I know) are testimony by officers who were present at the time. 

## Contributing
Partial contributions are extremely welcome.

Each file will have an accompanying .txt file. If you have a suggestion for standardization, please submit a request or contact me directly.

The end goal will be to create a direct parallel document in PDF format that shows the direct translation side-by-side with the original text. This will be done automatically, so just provide the translation and I will handle the rest

I will try to have every pull request reviewed by a secondary translator when possible to ensure accuracy. 

Contributors will be credited in thanks.md. If you would like to be credited using another name, or not be credited at all, please mention this in your pull request
