WIP repository for translating a the bulletin of the State Council of China 

[Source](http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2011-11/09/content_1989024.htm)


## Objective 
Provide a reliable and unbiased (as much as possible) translation of documents pertaining to the 1989 protests. These documents (as far as I know) are testimony by officers who were present at the time. I would like to freely provide these translated documents to the western public as part of an effort to dispell misinformation that tends to be spread regarding these incidents

## Contributing
Partial contributions are welcome.

Each file will have an accompanying .txt file. A basic standardized format has been provided in the root directory. Simply copy the file into your target folder, and begin translating. A full translation is not necessary, just provide whatever you can. If you have a suggestion for standardization, please submit a request or contact me directly.

Submit a pull request to have have your content merged into the main branch.

The end goal will be to create a direct parallel document in PDF format that shows the direct translation side-by-side with the original text. This will be done automatically, so just provide the translation and I will handle the rest

I will try to have every pull request reviewed by a secondary translator when possible to ensure accuracy. 

Contributors will be credited in thanks.md. If you would like to be credited using another name, or not be credited at all, please mention this in your pull request
